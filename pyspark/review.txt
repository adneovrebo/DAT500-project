generated at high energy 0 colliders such as lep2 and a future next linear collider nlc the largest fraction of these will come from so called no tag events in which neither of the leptons generating the photons is seen however due to the high energy and luminosity of these machines a sizeable number of them will be produced in events where either the outgoing 6 or 7 is tagged single tag events in such events the photon coming from the tagged leptonis far off shell and spacelike hence this reaction amounts to deeply inelastic electroproduction of heavy quarks on a photon target an important aspect of on shell photons initiating a hard scattering is that they may behave either as pointlike particles direct process or as hadronic vector particles resolved process in no tagevents both the direct and resolved process contribute to the cross section at lep2they contribute in about equal amounts to the cross section for charm production in two photon collisions in such events one can separate these components by making use of forward detectors and using the presence of a remnant jet of spectator partons in resolved processes as a separator the interesting feature of single tag heavy quark events is that this separation occurs quite naturally in the deeply inelastic bjorken scaling variable 4 as we will show below moreover the presence of the heavy quark mass ensures that this separation is unambiguous to next to leading order nlo in qcd the direct process is directly calculable in qcd and is free from such phenomenological inputs as parton densities in the photon the resolved channel on the other hand is directly proportional to the poorly known gluon density in the photon therefore a reasonable sample of single tag heavy quark events allows one to confront simultaneously a well controlled perturbative qcd calculation with experiment and constrain the gluon density in the photon in the past open heavy quark mainly charm production in two photon collisions at 0 colliders has been difficult to observe in experiments due to the low charm acceptance the reaction 8 has been thoroughly studied experimentally the existence of the 9 has been inferred either from direct reconstruction or from unfolding the distribution of soft pions resulting from its decay in addition measurements have been made using soft leptons and kaons to tag the charm jade and tpc two gamma have performed experimental studies of the reaction 8 with one outgoing lepton tagged at low average value 10 of the momentum transfer squared of the tagged lepton below 11 topaz has performed a study as well at somewhat larger 12 the total number of events obtained was however very small about 30 for topaz see for a more extensive review of the experimental situation the cross section and single particle distributions for 13 have been calculated to next to leading order nlo in qcd in and agree with experimental results correlations in the direct channel were studied in for the single tag case the structure functions 14 and 15 for charm production were calculated to nlo in qcd in in this letterwe employ the results of to estimate the expected number of single tag events in 5 bins for lep2 and a nlc and examine differential distributions in the transverse momentum and rapidity of the charm quark in section 2we describe the formalism and explain our notation in section 3we show the structure function 14 for charm production give estimates of event rates in 5 bins for the case of lep2 and a nlc and show single charm quark differential distributions we summarize and conclude in section 4 we consider the reaction see fig1 16 where 17 is a heavy quark with momentum 18 and 19 denotes any hadronic state allowed by quantum number conservation laws when the outgoing electron is tagged this reaction is dominated by the subprocess 20 where one of the photons is highly virtual and the other is almost on mass shell and transversely polarized the case where the positron is tagged is completely equivalent this process is described by the differential cross section 21 aligned where the 22 23 denote the doubly differential deeply inelastic photon structure functions 24 is the fine structure constant and 25 the heavy quark mass 26 is the center of mass energy squared of the 27 system the bjorken scaling variables 4 and 28 are defined by 29 further we define the variables 30 the momenta of the off shell photon and the on shell photon obey the relations 31 and 32 respectively because the photon with momentum 33 is almost on mass shell 3 is written in the weizscker williams approximation the function 34 represents the probability of finding a photon 35 in the positron with longitudinal momentum fraction 36 it is given by 37 where 38 and 39 here40 is the lepton beam energy and 41 is the anti tag angle in the rest of the calculation 42 in eq 3 the differential structure functions can be represented as 43 where 44 represents 45 and 46 the two terms represent the contributions to the structure functions from pointlike or direct and hadronic or resolved photons respectively the 47 are photonic parton densities and the 48 are differential wilson coefficient functions and 49 is the mass factorization scale at lowest order only the photonic gluon density appears in eq seven 14 and15 were calculated in to nlo in qcd by computing all 50 corrections to the coefficient functions 51 we use the results of this calculation for the present analysis coupling constant renormalizationwas performed in the 52 scheme modified such that heavy flavours decouple in loops when small momenta flow into the fermion loop and mass renormalization in the on shell scheme mass factorization was also performed in the 52 scheme see for further details note the absence of the scale 49 in the second term on the right hand side of eq seven this is due to the fact that through nlo the heavy quark mass prevents a collinear singularity from occurring in the pointlike piece for massless quarks this singularityis subtracted at scale 49 and absorbed into the hadronic piece as a consequence 53 is calculable the only theoretical uncertainties stemming from 54 and the heavy quark mass whereas 55 is primarily sensitive to the gluon density in the photon in analogy to the proton case we will see that the two components on the right hand side in eq seven dominate in different regions of the bjorken variable 4 from eq 3 we will estimate the numbers of events expected per 5 bin at lep2 and a future nlc in analyzing charm production we will also show differential distributions in transverse momentum and rapidity of the detected charm quark in the 56 cm these quantities are derived from the variables defined in the above as follows we define 57 to be the invariant mass squared 58 and 59 the transverse mass of the heavy quark in the 60 frame is determined by 61 the transverse mass is the same in the 56 frame further in the 60 frame the energy of the heavy quark is 62 its longitudinal momentum can be found from the condition 63 so its rapidity in the 60 frame is 64 in the 56 frame 65 we define a particle to have positive rapidity when it travels into the hemisphere from which the 66 originates 85 cm we first list our choices for various quantities used in the calculations of this section deviations from them will be explicitly indicated we used for 25 the heavy quark mass the value 67 gev for charm and 68 gev for bottom we assumed a center of mass energy 69 500 gev for lep2 nlc for the strong coupling we took a one loop running 54 with three four light flavours and 70 200 mev at lo and a two loop running 54 with 71 200 mev at nlo for charm bottom we put the renormalization scale equal to the factorization 49 and chose 72 we also imposed the following requirements on the angle and energy of the tagged lepton 73 for lep2 nlc and 74 where 75 these cuts imply a minimum 76 of 365 77 for lep2 and 50 77 at our hypothetical nlc furthermore we used the grv parton densities for the hadronic photon results and the weizscker williams density of with a 78 for the equivalent target photon spectrum for the total integrated luminosity of lep2 nlc we used 79 80 at a nlc beamstrahlung effects are expected to play an important rle we include them here by adopting for its spectrum the expression given in with parameters 81 and 82 mm corresponding to the tesla design when showing differential distributions we will show them from the point of view of the 83 cm frame _ie _ we assume here that the electron is tagged and take the case where the positron is tagged into account by multiplying the results with a factor 2 we begin by showing in fig2 the quantities 84 and 85 versus 4 both at lo and nlo for 86 the 50 corrections to both quantities are for the most part fairly small in the 4region shown we may therefore assume that even higher order contributions are negligible and these components are thus calculated with some accuracy the prominent feature in these figures is clearly the separation in 4 of the components this fact was already noted in and we emphasize it here as a result the opportunity to confront a precise calculation and measure the small4 photonic gluon density presents itself in one experiment as mentioned earlier the difficulty of efficient charm tagging makes such an experimental study very difficult in practice to judge the feasibility of such a study we have integrated eq 3 for various 5 bins and obtained estimates for the number of charm quarks per bin produced at lep2 and nlc by both hadronic and pointlike photons note that these estimates use the nlo calculation to perform the integrals over 4 and 76 we used fitted versions of the _ integrated _ nlo coefficient functions 87 in eq seven as the actual expressions in are too long for fast evaluation by adapting the fitted coefficient functions of electroproduction of heavy quarks on a proton target to the photon target we were able to speed up our computer program by as much as a factor of fifty the results for lep2 are shown in tables 1 and 2 we give in these tables the expected number of events due to pointlike table 1 and hadronic table 2 photons assuming a charm tagging efficiency of 1 2 we that on average a few tens of events per bin should be observable for larger 4 values furthermore to test the stability of the results we varied the renormalization factorization scale 49 from 88 to 89 the results change relatively little under these variations as seen in tables 1 and 2 for these lep2 conditions we varied in addition the charm quark mass from 90 gev to 91 gev and found that the pointlike contribution table 1 changed under this variation in the charm mass by less than 10 in all bins except in the 4 bins 92 in these bins the mass variation causes a variation in the position of the charm quark production threshold and from the shape of 84 in fig2 one may readily understand that this causes a large change in the number of events as much as 70 in the lowest 76 bin the sensitivity of the hadronic contribution table 2 to these changes is much more uniform in 4 varying from 30 40 in the lowest 76 bin to 10 20 in the higher 76 bins in table 3we give similar estimates for the nlc both for charm and bottom production herewe have summed the contributions due to pointlike and hadronic photons for each entry we do however show separately the number of events due to beamstrahlung and weizscker williams bremsstrahlung contributions note that the number of charmed events here is truly large even at large 76 the number of events containing bottom quarks is much smaller due to charge and phase space suppression clearly the production rate of charm quarks produced by hadronic photons is too small at lep2 to be useful for a good measurement of the gluon density in the photon at a nlcthe rates are significantly higher however we therefore give in table 4 the production rate for a nlc in 5 bins for various choices of parton densities charm quark mass values and mass factorization scales examining the composition of these results we find very little contribution due to the hadronic channel from beamstrahlung photons about 1 2 we further find the contributions due to pointlike photons both of ww and beamstrahlung origin to be similarly small there is therefore a good possibility of measuring the gluon density in the photon at a nlc poor tagging efficiency notwithstanding the most significant uncertainty is related to the charm quark mass however a differentiation of the gluon densities of grv and acfgp seems certainly feasible while bottom quark production lends itself to considerably better tagging efficiencies the production rate is severely suppressed relative to charm an analysis similar to the one for charm reveals that a measurement of the photonic gluon density from bottom production in 1 scattering does not seem possible at a nlc we turn to single particle inclusive differential distributions in transverse momentum 93 and rapidity 28 of the heavy quark in the 56 cm frame due to the low rate of bottom quark productionwe only show these distributions for the case of charm we integrate 4 and 76 over the intervals 94 and 95 gev96 for lep2 nlc to approximate detector limitations we use the restrictions 97 gev and 98 in addition to the cuts listed in the beginning of this section the 93 restriction is of course quite loose but it allows us to study the behavior of the 93 spectrum at low 93 furthermore for the results shown in figs3 and 4 we took the factorization renormalization scale 99 85 cm in fig3a we present for lep2 the lo and nlo 93distributions of the charm quark for the pointlike and hadronic piece separately in neither instancedo the lo and nlo curves differ significantly while the hadronic piece at nlo is larger than the lo at large 93 which is similar to what was found for a proton target in the reverse is true for the pointlike piece the bulk of the events has 100 gev in fig3bthe same is shown but now for the rapidity distribution clearly the charm quark has predominantly negative rapidity in figs4a and 4bwe present for the nlc the 93 spectrum results due to pointlike and hadronic photons for a weizscker williams spectrum and a beamstrahlung photon spectrum both spectra lead to similar plots as for lep2 in fig3a the dominance near small 93 of the beamstrahlung piece is due to the small final state invariant mass preferred by the beamstrahlung spectrum we have argued in this letter that a measurement of the cross section for heavy quark production in single tag two photon events is interesting because it enables one to compare a well controlled qcd calculation with data at large 4 and constrain the gluon content of the photon at small 4 assuming a not overly pessimistic charm acceptance a measurement of the pointlike structure function seems feasible at lep2 and both the pointlike and hadronic structure functions are certainly measurable at a future nlc w bartel et al jade phys lett b184 1987 288 aj finch in proceedings of the viii international workshop on photon
